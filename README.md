# Pokedex
This project is an **interactive Pokedex** built with **Astro**, **React**, and **HTMX**. It allows users to explore different Pokemon, view their details, and perform interactions as searching.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: A static site generation framework that allows integrating various libraries and frameworks, such as React and HTMX.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **HTMX**: A library that enables making AJAX requests without writing additional JavaScript, which makes interactions easier and faster.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps create modern and responsive user interfaces with ease.
- **Pokemon API**: A public API is used to fetch information about the Pokemon.

## Features

- **Search by name**: You can search for Pokemon by their name and get results quickly.
- **Interactivity**: With HTMX, the Pokedex can load more Pokemon when you reach the end of the list without reloading the page.
- **Responsive design**: The application is optimized for devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

### Pokemon Guesser Game
In addition to the Pokedex, I've also added a Pokemon Guesser game. In this game, you will be shown a Pokemon's image with its colors inverted, and you have to guess its name.

How it works: You will have a limited number of attempts to guess the Pokemon's name.
Guess by letter or full name: You can guess the name of the Pokemon by typing a letter or the full name.
Interactive gameplay: If you guess correctly, you'll see a Pokemon image, and some confetti will be triggered to celebrate!! ðŸ¥³
